ITTTL is an informal table tennis league for Indianapolis-area tech companies to meet new people and battle for table tennis supremecy.

This is the home page for [itttl.org][link]. 

To run the server locally, run `bundle install` and then run `jekyll serve --watch`.

Add new teams to `_config.yml`, the server needs to be restarted for the changes to take effect 
(despite the `--watch` flag).
